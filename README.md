Purpose
this project was made to calculate the salary,taxes,and hours of working of employees.
We have two employees their scedule and percent of taxes, the output calculate for us and output brings us the calculation of the salary of the employee.
The code is divided into logical modules and functions for better organization and reusability, enhancing maintainability and scalability.
User inputs are validated to prevent errors and ensure the integrity of the property data, enhancing the reliability of the application.
Data sructures is using <bits/stdc++.h> it include all libraries of c++ language so that it is much easier to use. Likewise in this code we use struct so that it could calculate the salary of the certained employee.
